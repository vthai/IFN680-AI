#    # Experiment 1:
#    # Player 1 and Player 2 are evenly matched with 3-ply deep search
#    # player 2 wins with a final score of 28

#    # Experiment 2:
#    # now we show the significance of an evaluation function
#    # we weaken player1 to 2 ply deep but use the edge eval fun
#    # player 1 now beats player 2 with a score of 58!
